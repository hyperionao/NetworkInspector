# NetworkInspector
I am building a network inspector that monitors internet performance by running periodic speed tests and logging the data. The project will include both backend and frontend components, with a database to store historical network data and APIs to interact with the system. The data can be visualized through graphs and reports, and I  will also incorporate basic security, authentication, and best coding practices like unit testing and version control.

Will update read me as we go!
